### Hoban Lab ggplot2 introduction 

*****

A walk through of basic data visualization with ggplot2. The exercise utilizes base tidyverse packages.

My walk through was adapted from [this tutorial](https://uc-r.github.io/ggplot_intro) and [this tutorial](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jerrick/courses/stat701/notes/ggplot2.html#representing-higher-dimensions-in-scatter-plots)


To walk through my Frankenstein tutorial effectively, you should download one of the following:

* [the rmd document](https://github.com/HobanLab/ggplot2_intro_and_walkthrough/tree/main/walkthrough_document/code_walkthrough.Rmd) (best if you already know mark down and/or don't want to type a single thing)

* [the pdf document](https://github.com/HobanLab/ggplot2_intro_and_walkthrough/tree/main/walkthrough_document/code_walkthrough.pdf) (best if you want to create your own R script with your own notes)

* [the html document](https://github.com/HobanLab/ggplot2_intro_and_walkthrough/tree/main/walkthrough_document/code_walkthrough.html) (best if you don't want to deal with the pesky page breaks of a pdf)
